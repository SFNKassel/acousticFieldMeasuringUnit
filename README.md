# acousticFieldMeasuringUnit
A programm for measuring different types of accoustic fields.

To run the 2D measuring unit simply download the acousticFieldMeasuringUnit.jar and execute it. It requires Java 8 to run.

The sampling rate of 44100 samples/second is supported by most soundcards. Some soundcards are supporting higher sampling rates (eg. 48000 s/s, 96000 s/s, 192000 s/s). 

The longer the measurement time is, the less is the noise in the resulting value.

The visualisation multiplyer depends on your setup and defines the sensitivity of the integrated visualisation.
